Our creative ai application reads from an inventory of preloaded songs and generates a custom Christmas song based on language patterns found in the loaded songs. It then outputs the song as a tweet.
We reused sentences in our song to create a chorus with repeated lines, as well as implementing a functions that standardizes the number of syllables per line. Additionally, we implemented a function to rhyme certain lines by comparing the last few letters of the last word in those lines.
We output our song to a twitter account and allow the user to input a name that shows up as who the song is addressed to.

Enjoy!
