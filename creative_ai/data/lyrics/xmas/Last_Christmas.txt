I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (A mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it? (Do it)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

But Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
Should've known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it?

But Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Ooh yeah
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

This is our Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas.
You broke my heart
Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas
You broke my heart
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (A mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it? (Do it)''''''''''''''''''
