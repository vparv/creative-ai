Santa, tell me if you're really there;
Don't make me fall in love again iIf he won't be here next year...
Santa, tell me if he really cares,
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year...

Feeling Christmas all around, and I'm trying to play it cool,
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room...
"Let it Snow" is blasting now, but I won't get in the mood;
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love that he thinks of,
So next Christmas, I'm not all alone, boy...

Santa, tell me if you're really there;
Don't make me fall in love again iIf he won't be here next year...
Santa, tell me if he really cares,
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year...

I've been down this road before - fell in love on Christmas night,
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side...
Now I need someone to hold, be my fire in the cold;
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love that he thinks of,
So next Christmas, I'm not all alone, boy!

Santa tell me if you're really there;
Don't make me fall in love again iIf he won't be here next year...
Santa tell me if he really cares,
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year...

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh, ooh...
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh, ooh...
But I don't want no broken heart - this year, I've got to be smart...
Oh, baby! (Santa, tell me... Santa, tell me...) 
(Santa, tell me...) If he will be, if he will be here... (Santa, tell me...) Oh!

(Santa tell me if you're really there;) 'Cause I really care...
(Don't make me fall in love again if) he won't be here next year...
(Santa tell me if he really cares,) Tell me! Tell me, babe...
('Cause I can't give it all away if) he won't be here next year...

(Santa tell me if you're really there;) Tell me! Tell me, baby!
(Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year...) If he won't be, if he won't be here...
(Santa tell me if he really cares,) Tell me... do you care?
'Cause I can't give it all away if he) won't be here next year...''''''''''''''''''
