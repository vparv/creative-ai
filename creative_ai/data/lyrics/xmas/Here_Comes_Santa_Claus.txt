Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, 
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer's
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle-jangle
Oh, what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows we're all God's children
That makes everything right
So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer, 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when chimes ring out 
That it's Christmas morn' again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the lord above, 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer's
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!''''&''''&''''''''
