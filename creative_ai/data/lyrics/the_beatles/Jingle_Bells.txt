Jingle, jangle
Jingle, jangle
Jingle, jangle, jingle, jangle
Jingle, jangle, jingle, jangle

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way (Jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way (Jingle all the way)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way 
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white (Now the ground is white)
Go it while you're young (Go it while you're young)
Take the girls tonight (Take the girls)
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay (Get a bob-tailed bay)
Two-forty for his speed (For his speed)
Then, hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead
Oh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh''''''''&''''''''
