When December comes, I bet you want to
Wrap me all up and take me home with you...
See what I look like under them lights;
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do...

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime;
I'm just tryna to give you something to remember through the summertime...

And whatever is on your list, I'll do it;
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it... yeah...

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
I'm the present, and you know it, here I am, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
I'm the present, and you know it, boy...

I'll give you the fire I keep inside,
Guide you all the way down, be your nightlight,
Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste;
Unwrap me now - been waiting since midnight...

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime;
I'm just tryna to give you something to remember through the summertime...

And whatever is on your list, I'll do it;
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it... yeah...

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
I'm the present, and you know it, here I am, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy... ah...
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy;
I'm a present, and you know it, here I am, boy... ah...''''&''''&''''&''''''
