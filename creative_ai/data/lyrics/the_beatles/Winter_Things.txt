It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from;
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun...
My jacket don't get no love, no hats and no gloves, not even a chance of rain,
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown, (No, no, no, downtown...)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out... (Oh...)
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build - most of our friends at the beach,
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Just imagine that we're laughing in our cabin, chilling by the fireside;
Even though this sun is blasting, we can be wherever if we visualize...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...''''&''''&''''&''''''
