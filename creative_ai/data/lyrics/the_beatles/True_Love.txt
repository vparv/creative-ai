On the first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On the second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me
That promise ring to keep till we get old, boy

On the third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said I love you and meant it
On the fourth we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
You are my true love

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got a tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
And nothing's shining more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, you are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
You are my true love''''&''''&''''&''''''
