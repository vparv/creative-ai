'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Nicholas soon would be there

Then what to my wondering eyes should appear
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
A little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick

And more rapid than eagles, his reindeer all came
As he shouted on Dasher and each reindeer's name

And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound
He was dressed all in fur and his belly was round

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stocking then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose

But I heard him exclaim where he drove out of sight
"Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night"

But I heard him exclaim where he drove out of sight
"Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night"''''''''''''''''''
