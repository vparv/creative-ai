Come and kiss me, baby - we don't need no mistletoe, mm;
We don't need no fireplace - boy, I'll keep you nice and warm, hey...
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies? Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy,
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play...

'Tis the season for some love giving,
So I think you should give your love to me...
Baby, let me know...

Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know...)
Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas?

We don't need no presents, we don't need the kitchen, we don't need them recipes;
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread, made with love...
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies? Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy,
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play...

'Tis the season for some love giving,
So I think you should give your love to me...
Baby, let me know...

Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know...)
Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas?''''&''''&''''&''''''
