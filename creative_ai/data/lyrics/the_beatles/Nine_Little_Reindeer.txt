A long long time ago,
As all you folks should know
Ol' Santa started loading up his sleigh.
A smile on every face,
Each reindeer took his place,
To bring us joy on Christmas Day.
With one little, two little, three little reindeer,
Four little, five little, six little reindeer,
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh.

There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comit, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen.
But there's one little reindeer missing Rudolf is his name.

For a long long time
He had hitched up nine
To make his Christmas ride
Now Rudolph's gone
He's so alone
Santa Claus sat down and cried

With one little, two little, three little reindeer,
Four little, five little, six little reindeer,
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh.

It's been a year
Since we've been here
And how the time it goes
Where have you been
My little friend
Shining up my nose

With one little, two little, three little reindeer,
Four little, five little, six little reindeer,
Seven little, eight little, nine little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh.

Peace on earth and goodwill to all,
And a very merry Christmas day''''&''''&''''&''''''
