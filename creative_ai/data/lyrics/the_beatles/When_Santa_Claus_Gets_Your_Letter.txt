Songwriter: Johnny Marks;

When Santa Claus gets your letter,
You know what he will say:
"Have you been good the way you should
On ev'ry single day?"

When Santa gets your letter
To ask for Christmas toys,
He'll take a look in his good book
He keeps for girls and boys.

He'll stroke his beard, his eyes will glow,
And at your name he'll peer;
It takes a little time, you know,
To check back one whole year!

When Santa Claus gets your letter,
I really do believe,
You'll head his list, you won't be missed,
By Santa on Christmas Eve. 

(Instrumental)
